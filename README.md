Grid Overlay JavaScript Plugin
==========================
A raw JavaScript plugin that creates an overlay on your site for easy alignment of design elements to your grid during development.

Include the Code
----------------
Grab the [file/code](https://raw.github.com/freshtilledsoil/gridOverlay/master/javascripts/gridOverlay.js) and call it at the end of your document:
'''html
    <script src="javascripts/gridOverlay.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
'''

Demo
----
Toggle the grid visibility with Option + G (Mac) or Alt + G (PC). Visit the [demo page](http://freshtilledsoil.github.com/gridOverlay) to try it out.

Options
-------
The JS file includes variables that can be reset so you can specify _page width_, _column width_, _column color_, _gutter width_, _gutter color_, _baseline height_, _baseline color_ and whether or not the grid is _visible on page load_ or has to be toggled on.

Please Note
-----------

The SASS mixin this project started with has been moved to a GitHub Gist as this project changes to a plugin. You can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/3013151) if you're interested.
